# How City Council Works Now

Our Chicago City Council works on three classes of legislation

* bills that will affect policy for the entire city
* bills that provides substantial benefits to individual people or
  businesses, such as zoning changes or tax abatements
* routine bills that permit businesses to use the public way--street
  signs, sidewalk cafes

Aldermen engage differently with the different classes of bills.

# City Wide Policy

Major legislation is mainly introduced to the City Council by the
Mayor, although aldermen are starting to initiate more legislation
themselves.

Before introduction, the mayor's policy team has consulted with their
aldermen and incorporated some of their concernss into the intial
draft.

Immediately upon introduction to Council, nearly all legislation is
referred to a committee. A piece of major legislation won't be
released from committee for a full council vote until the success of
the vote is assured.

## Amendment in committee
In Committees, aldermen can and do amend proposed legislation to
address their concerns. Aldermen can influence the bill regardless of
whether they sit on the responsible committee. 

In committee, aldermen have two procedures they can used to amend
legislation. The first is a motion to amend. A committee member makes
this motion, proposing specific changes to a bill. The motion to amend
is voted on, and if it passes the bill is amended. Alternatively, an
committee member can make a motion to substitute. Here, the entire
bill is substituted and all the negotiated changes to bills are
incorporated all at once. The only way to find out what's changed is
to carefully compare the different versions of the bill.

Committees typically uses substitution for major legislation.

## Passing out of Committee

Committee chairmen determine the agenda for their committees and
decide when a committee will consider a bill and pass it out of
committee. Formally, a committee passes a bill out of committee when
it votes upon the motions of "Recommended to Pass" or "Recommended Do
Not Pass".

Committee chairs can choose to never consider a bill. If a bill has
been in committee for 30 days, the bill's sponsor can request that the
committee chair make a written report to the City Council on why the
committee hasn't considered the bill. Committee chairs have submitted
no such reports in last X years.

If a bill has sat in committee for 60 days, any aldermen may make a
motion to discharge the bill from committee. This motion requires a
majority of the city council to pass. This motion has never been made.

### Committee Meetings

At committee meetings, when committees formal consider bills, there
can be discussion among the committee about a bill and the public has
an opportunity to testify on each bill.

Committee meetings are recorded and transcribed. The transcriptions
can be accessed through FOIA. Additionally, a list of people who
testified before the committee can FOIAed. These are called oppose/
support slips or witness slips.


## City Council Vote

At the city council meetings, the majority of city council almost
always follows the committee recommendations, often unanimously.

[evidence of agreement with committee recs]
[evidence of rareness of split votes]

An important exception is when a alderman makes a motion to "Pass as
substitute". In this motion, the council votes to both substitute the
entire bill that has been passed out committee and immediately pass this version of the bill which has not been considered by committee.

[examples of this]


## Sponsorships
If a major bill is coming from the Office of the Mayor, it will typically be sponsored by the Mayor alone.

If a major bill comes from the city council, an alderman will be the
lead sponsor, and he or she will attempt to get as many other aldermen
as possible to co-sponsor the bill. Cosponsorship sends a strong
signal that the aldermen will vote for a bill and can pressure a
committee chair to pass a bill out of committee.

Over the past few years, succesful council initiated legislation has
had the majority of alderman signing on as cosponsors.

## Lobbying

There are few restrictions on lobbying city council.

* A former alderman has to wait a year from leaving office before lobbying
* former department heads and mayoral staff have to wait two years
* lobbyists can't give more than $1500 a year to aldermen
* lobbyists can't work on contigency
* lobbyists can't lobby at a meeting of the city council

and weak disclosure

* Lobbyists for for-profit organziations have to register each year
* Lobbyists for trade associations and unions have to register
* Lobbyists for other non-profits don't have to register
* Registered lobbyists have to report, quarterly, their lobbying
  activity, compensation and expenditures, campaign contributions, and
  an itemized list of all gifts given to city personnel
* Registered lobbyists have to report who they lobbied for, but don't
  have to report the specific alderman they lobbied or the specific
  legislation they discussed
* Lobbyist's clients don't have to register

Because disclosure is infrequentj, not specific, and excludes many
advocacy, nonprofit organizaions, it is not effectively impossible to
know who is lobbying for what outcomes on different bills.


## Legislative Reference Bureau

The legislative reference bureau helps aldermen research and draft
ordinances.
